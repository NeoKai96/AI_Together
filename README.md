# AI_Together

*Last edited by [zen-star](//github.com/zen-star), March 16th, 2019*

This is the repo specially for our small group to learn AI together. Members are all from __ZJUAI CLUB__, from freshmen/women to graduates. We would like to motivate each other to learn AI with the help of _Wechat_ and _github_. Useful resources, notes, interview preparations, trial codes, etc. are included.

The repo will be maintained by zen-star, and the README.md will record members'  _HAVEDONE_ s and _TODO_ s. Hope this repo will last long enough and benefit members or even more AI fans.
